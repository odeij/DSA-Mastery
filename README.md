#DSA-MASTERY - From Foundations To Interview-Ready

This is my 12 week, hands-on roadmap to master Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
We start by **implementing core data structures in C** (week 1-4), switch to **High level coding language for fast problem-solving** (week 5-10), and finish with **advanced topics** (week 11-12). Everything is project based with daily drills and short write-ups.

## What's inside

- **Foundations (C):** arrays/strings, linked lists, stacks/queues, hashing
- **Core Mastery (Python):** recursion/backtracking, binary search, sorting, trees, graphs, heaps, union-find, dynamic programming
- **Elite/Polish (Py + optional C++):** tries, bit tricks, segment/Fenwick trees, interview prep, mock interviews
- **Mini-projects:** CSV grep, LRU cache, expression evaluator, file deduper, Sudoku solver, log aggregator, filesystem index, maze pathfinder, job scheduler, string aligner, autocomplete, and a capstone
